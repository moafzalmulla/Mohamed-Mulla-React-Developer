# Mohamed-Mulla-React-Developer

Below is the titles of folders included in this repo, and a descripton 

## 1.Docker:
This folder Docker compose file that sets up Wordpress on http://localhost:8080 after running ```docker-compose up -d ```

## 2.React/Gatsby/GraphQL:
This folder contains my build script for a Gatsby project that builds around 1215 static web pages in around 8 mins, using Node & Gatsby API. The script also builds a Client side JS search index in ASYNC using AXIOS.

Alongside this file is single-wp-page JS and SCSS files. This is a Gatsby, single page template that consumes data from a Wordpress Rest API using GraphQL. I used the GraphiQL Explorer to explore API's to select the data that we needed from the API's

PS. All in all in this project I pulled data from around 4 different apis, at the same time - to build 1 sites static pages: 

- Wordpress Rest API
- Contentful API
- XML site map gatsby plugin
- Press page XML gatsby plugin

## 3.React/Redux:
In this folder, I have included 1 example of a functional component, that uses Styled Components, Prop-Types (I am currently integrating this on a listing page that uses React Hooks to useState, useEffect, etc.
